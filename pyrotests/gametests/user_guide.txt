						User Guide

Once you have installed the requisite libraries (see installation_guide.txt), you can start playing the game! Here's how...

Command Line Interface:

	First, make sure you've changed directories to the one to which you unzipped the game file.

	Next, type "cd /pyrotests/gametests"

	Then, type "python2 initiateplay.py"

	The game should start automatically. Follow on-screen directions from there.
