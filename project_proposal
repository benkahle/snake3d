Mega-super Snake Game
For our software design final project, we would like to make an elaborate snake game taken to the next level. We plan to use visual python to make a 3-d snake game which also plays with camera angles, possibly switching between third person and first person camera views. We also want to add new elements to the game, like having two snakes competing. This would require making two computers network with each other
Our ninja is Hannah.
